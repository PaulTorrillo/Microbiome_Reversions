# Microbiome_Reversions
Code and data repository for the manuscript "Reversions mask the contribution of adaptive evolution in microbiomes" by Paul Torrillo and Tami Lieberman.

Currently under construction

In each figure file, one should find the script that plots it, and if relevant, the script that runs the simulation for the plot. There should also be pre generated simulations outputs to reproduce the runs from the manuscript.

Please inquire at torrillo@mit.edu for any questions or assistance
