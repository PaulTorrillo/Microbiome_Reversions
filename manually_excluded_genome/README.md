The methodology for choosing which genomes to plot was to find species with at least ten data points with a divergence below 0.0005 dS. We wanted to plot ten species and 11 satisfy this constraint. One is Bacteroides Vulgatus, though it does not have many data points less than this. Vulgatus has many data points at high divergence values and when fitting the reversion model,the best fit actually has the crossover occur at very high divergence values to minimize variance rather than early on. Thus, between the relatively small amount of low divergence data points coupled with this difficulty fitting, we chose this species to cut to get to ten. You can see the data points here.
